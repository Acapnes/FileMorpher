# FileMorpher - LAN Web Portal for Windows File Conversions

Welcome to the FileMorpher project! This initiative was developed during my internship and represents a remarkable journey into creating a versatile Node.js-based Windows service. The heart of the project is the automated conversion of files within a specified folder. This is made possible through a custom Windows service and a user-friendly LAN web portal.

## Project Overview

FileMorpher introduces a seamless solution for converting files within a designated folder. This is achieved through the orchestration of a Node.js Windows service, which manages the entire conversion process. Meanwhile, an ExpressJS-powered LAN web portal, designed using EJS, offers a user-friendly interface for file selection, configuration, and result retrieval.

## Key Features and Technologies

- **Windows Service**: Employing Node.js, the project integrates a custom Windows service, driving file conversion and transfer tasks.

- **ExpressJS and EJS**: The ExpressJS framework enables the creation of a LAN web portal for user interaction. EJS enhances the web interface with dynamic content rendering.

- **MSSQL Database**: The application employs MSSQL for data storage and configuration management.

- **Bootstrap Styles**: The LAN web portal boasts an elegant and responsive design, elevated by Bootstrap styles.

- **Big Data Testing and Reporting**: Rigorous big data testing has been conducted, with comprehensive documentation of results and performance benchmarks.

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: An exhaustive user guide and comprehensive software documentation accompany the application, ensuring seamless adoption and future development.

## Logging and Log Management

The service includes a robust logging mechanism, with detailed operations and activities logged to a TXT file for comprehensive analysis and monitoring.

## About FileMorpher

FileMorpher simplifies file conversions within a Windows environment through seamless automation and user interaction. Access the LAN web portal on the specified port and choose the files you want to convert. Tailor the conversion process by configuring output formats, quality, and other parameters. Start the conversion process with a click. The Node.js Windows service takes over and processes the selected files. Track the conversion progress directly from the web portal as FileMorpher processes the files. Once conversions are done, download the converted files directly from the web interface. FileMorpher merges automation and user control, offering an efficient solution for file conversions in a Windows environment.
